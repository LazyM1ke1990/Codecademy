    <h1>HTML Anatomy</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        A web page at its basic form is composed and structured by using 'HTML Elements'.<br>
        These elements are made up from an 'opening tag' which is the element name enclosed in angled brackets,<br>
        'The content' and the 'closing tag' which closes the element. This too is in angled brackets but with a forward slash.<br>
        after the opening bracket to distinguish that it's the closing tag and not another opening tag.<br>
        An example is the paragraph element below:
    </p>

    <img src="./Snippets/Element_Example.png" alt="Paragraph Element">

    <ul>
        <li>Opening Tag <img src="./Snippets/Paragraph_Open_Tag.png" alt="Paragraph Opening Tag"></li><br>
        <li>The Content ("Hello World!" text)</li><br>
        <li>Closing Tag <img src="./Snippets/Paragraph_Closing_Tag.png" alt="Paragraph Closing Tag"></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        There are many different HTML tags to use which can do different things like add and orginise text, <br>
        Setup links to other webpages or add images and videos to the webpage.
